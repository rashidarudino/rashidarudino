## Hi there 👋
Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! 🌟
I'm just your recent fellow Computer Science graduate and Cluey Tutor since 2021, passionate about software and firmware programming. 
I enjoy exploring new frameworks and libraries used to build UIs. While I've explored PowerApps and tinkered with Platform IO for C++ coding on MCUs, my passion truly lies in building apps with React. There's nothing quite like seeing hot-reloads instantly update my media changes!

    🔭 I’m currently working on making tech more playful by creating tutorials at [Toycube](http://www.toycube.com.au/).  
    🌱 I’m currently learning how to turn code into magic (or at least trying to).  
    👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes the web more awesome!  
    🤔 I’m looking for help with finding the perfect balance between work and play.  
    💬 Ask me about my latest obsession: turning coffee into code.  
    📫 How to reach me: Shoot me a message, I promise I'm friendly!  
    😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
    ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to code on my pc via my mobile remote. Spoiler: It didn’t end well!
