## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my corner of the digital universe! ðŸŒŸ
I'm just your recent fellow Computer Science graduate and Cluey Tutor since 2021, passionate about software and firmware programming. 
I enjoy exploring new frameworks and libraries used to build UIs. While I've explored PowerApps and tinkered with Platform IO for C++ coding on MCUs, my passion truly lies in building apps with React. There's nothing quite like seeing hot-reloads instantly update my media changes!

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making tech more playful by creating tutorials at [Toycube](http://www.toycube.com.au/).  
    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to turn code into magic (or at least trying to).  
    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that makes the web more awesome!  
    ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding the perfect balance between work and play.  
    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my latest obsession: turning coffee into code.  
    ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me a message, I promise I'm friendly!  
    ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her  
    âš¡ Fun fact: I once tried to code on my pc via my mobile remote. Spoiler: It didnâ€™t end well!  

Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸš€
